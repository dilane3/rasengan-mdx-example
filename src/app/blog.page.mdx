# LayoutComponent

`LayoutComponent` is a functional component that defines the structure of a layout component.

## Example

```jsx
import { LayoutComponent, Outlet } from "rasengan";
 
const AppLayout: LayoutComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>
        <h1>App Layout</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        <Outlet />
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
 
AppLayout.path = "/";
 
export default AppLayout;
```

The `LayoutComponent` function component requires a `path` property to define the route layout that will be considered as the base path of all pages that will use the layout.

Inside the return, the `Outlet` component is used to render the child components of the layout.

<AlertBox>
- `props`: The props that will be passed to the layout component.
- `redirect`: The path to redirect the user.
</AlertBox>

## Properties and Methods

The `LayoutComponent` function has the following properties and methods:

### Properties 

#### path

- `path`: The path of the layout component. This is used to define the route layout that will be considered as the base path of all pages that will use the layout.

### Methods

- `loader()`: Similar to `getServerSideProps()` in Next.js, this method is used to make some operations on the server before the layout is rendered. It should return a promise with the result of the operations.

The `loader()` method is optional. The returned promise has to follow the following structure:

```jsx
type LoaderResponse = {
  props?: { [key: string]: any };
  redirect?: string
};
```
